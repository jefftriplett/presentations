- Built by humans
- Django app turned into a Hugo (static website generator)
- Maintained by Claude Code

---

## Hugo for DjangoUpgrade.com

- Static website generator
- Single binary file - no dependencies
- Cross-platform compatibility
- No-code solution for static hosting
- Alternative to Ruby/Python generators

## Big Unlock: URL Reading

### Beyond File Operations
- Instead of: "Open this JSON file"
- Better: "Read this website URL"
- Claude can fetch and parse web content
- Update local files based on live data

---

## Automated Updates

1. Point Claude to a URL
2. Read current Django versions
3. Update local JSON files automatically
4. Use CLAUDE.md as hints file
