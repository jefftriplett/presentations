## tl;dr My favorite is Claude Code

## Alternatives

- **Codex** is OpenAI's CLI product
- **Cursor CLI** is Cursor's CLI product
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** is GitHub's CLI product

^ Codex (OpenAI) is really good too and probably not worth switching
^ GitHub Copilot CLI is new and can work with both OpenAI and Anthropic's models

## "C" is for LLM CLI tools apparently

| name | company | models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Anthropic | Anthropic only |
| Codex | OpenAI | OpenAI only |
| Copilot CLI | GitHub | Anthropic or OpenAI |
| Cursor CLI | Cursor | Any |
